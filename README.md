# Example C# User Authentication

This is an example of authenticating as a user and listing the user's licenses.
The example is written in C# using the .NET framework.

## Running the example

First, install dependencies with [`dotnet`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet):

```
dotnet restore
```

Then run the program:

```
dotnet run
```

You should see log output indicating the current token and the user's license count:

```
